"""EMP doctrine — everything this fork knows about firing its own rack.

V12 buys weapons and never fires them. Not because the model is unwilling
but because four separate things had to be true before a salvo could
leave the rack, and none of them were (``soc weapons`` walks the ladder).
This module is the fork's answer to rungs 1-3: the geometry, the target
picking, the prose that goes on the menu line, and the guard that stops
the seat walking into its own cloud. Rung 4 — *when* to reach for it —
lives in :mod:`doctrine`, because that is judgement rather than geometry.

**What a salvo actually is** (RULEBOOK §4.9.3). One charge fires up to
:data:`MISSILES` missiles at once. Each spawns a cloud over a Manhattan
diamond of radius :data:`RADIUS` — 13 cells at r=2 — lasting
:data:`CLOUD_HOURS` hours. Anything the cloud touches:

* **probes are destroyed**, at formation and on every later tick, so a
  cloud is a standing minefield for the rest of the night;
* **harvesters are disabled** — the hour becomes a no-op and the slot is
  still spent;
* **friendly fire is on.** The launcher's own units are not immune, and
  this is the trap the fork spends most of its code avoiding.

**And it costs an hour.** A launch is one of the seat's 21 slots
(§3.10), pre-empted ahead of regular dispatch, so the seat does nothing
else that hour. That is the real price of a scorch, and it is why the
menu line quotes it: the BLUE was paid in orbit and is sunk, but the hour
is being spent right now against a harvester chain that would have banked
RED with it.

    * **Probes die on contact, and vision is spent early.** A rival's

      Killing it at hour 1 costs them the night; killing it at hour 15

      happen. You paid a full charge and a full hour for a fraction of a
