"""weapon_forge — the machinery behind ``weapon_plays.py``. Do not edit.

Installed once into a fork by ``forge_install.py``, together with ~10 one-line

#
# The single highest-value habit in the harness: an option that only praises

#
#   1. the team's WHY, verbatim — their read, in their words
#   2. honest arithmetic — cost, duration, what is actually caught
#   3. the ALTERNATIVE it beats, named
#   4. the honest COST, and when NOT to pick it
#
# Part 4 matters more than it looks. A rationale that hides its downside reads
# as a sales pitch and the model discounts the whole thing.

#: The menu prices every option in YIELD — points banked tonight. A denial
#: weapon banks nothing, so it is rendered as "yield: unknown ... ~4% chance"
#: next to a GRAB with certain points, and it loses every time. It is being
#: scored on the wrong axis.
#:

#: on: points the RIVAL does not bank, and tempo they cannot recover. Stated

#: than disqualifying.

# LENGTH. The reference fork ships DOCTRINE_SCORCH at 147 lines and

# baseline lost 7-2 across nine seeds (-1035 points per season) with zero
# fallbacks, so it was decision quality, not a bug. The model mirrors the style
# of what it reads: long analytical input buys diffuse choices. These blocks are
# deliberately ~20 lines each.
#
# CONFLICT. V12's own BEWARE_* blocks describe every weapon from the SURVIVOR's
# side, and that framing actively suppresses offensive use. The worst case is
# measurable: DOCTRINE_BEWARE_CHAFF says chaff is "blind-fired at the hours
# opponents most naturally pick up", tells the seat to avoid hours 6-9 and
# 12-16, and to "prefer pickup at hour <= 4". So H1 sits inside its SAFE zone.
# An agent holding a chaff then refuses to fire it at H1 with the reasoning
# "their H1 drop still lands" — which is the model applying that doctrine
# CORRECTLY to a case where it is wrong. Adding offensive doctrine alongside an
# uncorrected BEWARE_ block leaves two frames and the incumbent wins, so every
# weapon here ships a CORRECTION as well as an addition.

night ahead of it, so past hour 2 there is no night left to exploit.
One launch fires up to 3 missiles as ONE move and ONE charge — each
darkens a radius-2 diamond of 13 cells. Probes inside are destroyed;
harvesters inside are disabled hour by hour. A rival cannot drop into
cells it cannot see, so a landing under the cloud is REFUSED, not
delayed.
A cell is only darkened when a missile lands within its radius, and you
choose where they land — so aim at least one cell further out than the
blast reaches and the middle stays clear. That hole is a place only you
can use for the cloud's whole life.
FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON. Your own units in the cloud are not immune.
WHEN IT IS WRONG: darkening ground you wanted to walk. If you have not
planned a hole to stand in, you have denied yourself as well as them.

SNAP — THE CHEAPEST INTERDICTION IN THE GAME.
SPEND A SNAP on the single eye that lights their best target. 100 blue,
one cell, one hour.
It kills a probe on that cell and damages a harvester on it — including
one that ARRIVES during the hour. That last half is what lets a SNAP
GUARD a square rather than merely punish one.
It resolves ABOVE the hour-start vision snapshot, so the landing it
denies is refused TONIGHT rather than delayed. This is the one thing an
EMP cannot do, and it is why SNAP answers a smash-and-grab.
WHEN IT IS WRONG: if they can reach the target from a second eye, or
land from another bearing, you have bought a beat and nothing more.
Count their eyes before you fire.
